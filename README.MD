‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èSTRETCH GOALS‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

1. I've incorperated the Nanoid libraries for Id.
2. The "total amount" is located in the nav bar-Ive experimented with StyledComponents and the number changes color depending on how much money is in the account. 
3. There are numerous error flags when you enter in correct or poorly formatted information in either the new or the edit form.
4. On the backend you can query search directly--for ?amount=gt?/gte?(greater than AMOUNT) or lt?/lte?(less than entered AMOUNT) or you can view the transaction names in ASC or DESC order. (?names=asc/names=desc)
5. In the works--catagory creation.
